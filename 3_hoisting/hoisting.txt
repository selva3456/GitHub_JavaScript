<-----variable hoisting--->

     if we have declared any variable by using var keyword
     and we are trying to access that before it declartion
     output will be undefined
     because that declartion part will be moving to the top
     this is called as variable hoisting
           (or)
     moving the declartion top of the respective scope is known as
     hoisting

     types:

        i)variable hoisting
        ii)function hoisting

    i)variable hoisting

        1.by using var keyword
               declaration go to top of the scope and value initialized as
               undefined till actual initialization. Thats why if we try to 
               access before actual initialization we will get undefined

        2.by using let and const key word
               declaration go to top of the scope and value will not be 
               assigned till actual initialization.if we try to access 
               before actual initialization we will get reference error due to TDZ

     eg:
         console.log(a) //undefined
         var a=20;


    ii)function hoisting
          entire function goes to the top of the scope Thats why we call
          the function before declaration still it will work
          
<--What is the diff b/w == and === -->
  
   == will check only the values
   === it will check value with datatype

   console.log("20" == 20)  //true
   console.log("20" === 20) //false
